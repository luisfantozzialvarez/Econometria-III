	abstract = {The asymptotic power envelope is derived for point-optimal tests of a unit root in the autoregressive representation of a Gaussian time series under various trend specifications. We propose a family of tests whose asymptotic power functions are tangent to the power envelope at one point and are never far below the envelope. When the series has no deterministic component, some previously proposed tests are shown to be asymptotically equivalent to members of this family. When the series has an unknown mean or linear trend, commonly used tests are found to be dominated by members of the family of point-optimal invariant tests. We propose a modified version of the Dickey-Fuller t test which has substantially improved power when an unknown mean or trend is present. A Monte Carlo experiment indicates that the modified test works well in small samples.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes new tests for detecting the presence of a unit root in quite general time series models. Our approach is nonparametric with respect to nuisance parameters and thereby allows for a very wide class of weakly dependent and possibly heterogeneously distributed data. The tests accommodate models with a fitted drift and a time trend so that they may be used to discriminate between unit root nonstationarity and stationarity about a deterministic trend. The limiting distributions of the statistics are obtained under both the unit root null and a sequence of local alternatives. The latter noncentral distribution theory yields local asymptotic power functions for the tests and facilitates comparisons with alternative procedures due to Dickey & Fuller. Simulations are reported on the performance of the new tests in finite samples.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces a general procedure for decomposition of non-stationary time series into a permanent and transitory component allowing both components to be stochastic. The permanent component is shown to be a random walk with drift and the transitory or cyclical component is a stationary process with mean zero. The decomposition methodology, which depends only on past data and therefore is computable in ‘real time’, is applied to the problem of measuring and dating business ‘cycles’ in the portwar U.S. economy. We find that measured expansions and contractions are of roughly equivalent duration and that our dating of cyclical episodes tends to lead the traditional NBER dating and, to a lesser extent, the ‘growth cycle’ chronology of Zarnowitz and Boschan (1977).}

	abstract = {This paper first provides some useful results on a generalized random coefficient autoregressive model and a generalized hidden Markov model. These results simultaneously imply strict stationarity, existence of higher order moments, geometric ergodicity, and β-mixing with exponential decay rates, which are important properties for statistical inference. As applications, we then provide easy-to-verify sufficient conditions to ensure β-mixing and finite higher order moments for various linear and nonlinear GARCH(1,1), linear and power GARCH(p,q), stochastic volatility, and autoregressive conditional duration models. For many of these models, our sufficient conditions for existence of second moments and exponential β-mixing are also necessary. For several GARCH(1,1) models, our sufficient conditions for existence of higher order moments again coincide with the necessary ones in He and Terasvirta.},

We compare the econometric causal model with two popular causal frameworks: Neyman-Holland causal model and the do-calculus. The Neyman-Holland causal model is based on the language of potential outcomes and was largely developed by statisticians. The do-calculus, developed by Judea Pearl and co-authors, relies on Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and is a popular causal framework in computer science. We make the case that economists who uncritically use these approximating frameworks often discard the substantial benefits of the econometric causal model to the detriment of more informative economic policy analyses. We illustrate the versatility and capabilities of the econometric framework using causal models that are frequently studied by economists.},

	abstract = {It is widely known that when there are errors with a moving-average root close to −1, a high order augmented autoregression is necessary for unit root tests to have good size, but that information criteria such as the AIC and the BIC tend to select a truncation lag (k) that is very small. We consider a class of Modified Information Criteria (MIC) with a penalty factor that is sample dependent. It takes into account the fact that the bias in the sum of the autoregressive coefficients is highly dependent on k and adapts to the type of deterministic components present. We use a local asymptotic framework in which the moving-average root is local to −1 to document how the MIC performs better in selecting appropriate values of k. In Monte-Carlo experiments, the MIC is found to yield huge size improvements to the DFGLS and the feasible point optimal PT test developed in Elliott, Rothenberg, and Stock (1996). We also extend the M tests developed in Perron and Ng (1996) to allow for GLS detrending of the data. The MIC along with GLS detrended data yield a set of tests with desirable size and power properties.},

The presence of a unit root indicates that the time series is not stationary but that differencing will reduce it to stationarity. The tests proposed to data require specification of the number of autoregressive and moving average coefficients in the model. In this paper we develop a test for unit roots which is based on an approximation of an autoregressive-moving average model by an autoregression. The test statistic is standard output from most regression programs and has a limit distribution whose percentiles have been tabulated. An example is provided.},
